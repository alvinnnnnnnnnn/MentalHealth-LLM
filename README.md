## Quick Start
If you just want to use the chatbot, you can head down to this [link](https://luminai-chatbot.streamlit.app/)

If you want to find out more about the solution, you can follow these simple steps (Ensure that you have a GPU enabled device):
1. Install anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/) 
2. Install CUDA Toolkit from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) 
3. Install Git
4. Run the following lines in your terminal (either IDE or device)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alvinnnnnnnnnn/MentalHealth-LLM.git

# Create a conda environment
conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.9

# Activate the environment
conda activate ENV_NAME`

# Installing / Upgrading required libraries 
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```
5. Install [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) based on your OS

## Datasets Used
The chatbot has been trained using conversational data, which is supposed to mimick the patient and the therapist. 5 topics where chosen, and 100 conversations from each of these topics were gathered:
- General 
- Relationships 
- Insecurities
- Victim Mentality 
- Self-Improvement 


## Solution
Used `SmolLM2-360M-Instruct` from Hugging Face, and trained it on the custom dataset from above. 

Visit this [page](https://huggingface.co/alvinwongster/LuminAI) for the uploaded model on Hugging Face, because the final model results are too large to post onto github

## Model Metrics
To evaluate the chatbot's performance based on our use case, the following weighted metrics system was used:
- Empathy Score (40%): 
    - Measures how well the chatbot responds with empathy.
- Human-Likeness Score (20%):
    - Assesses how natural and human-like the responses feel.
- BERTScore (30%):  
    - Evaluates semantic similarity between chatbot replies and therapist responses. Split equally between F1, Recall and Precision
- Time taken (10%)
    - Time taken to generate a response, a shorter time optimizes user experience
